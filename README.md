# starr.os (UNFINISHED PROJECT)

## What is this?
This is an opinonated, yet minimal Linux distro I originally made for my own "<a href= "https://github.com/mishastarrrr-ctrl/starrbook">starrbook</a>" hardware, but can be used on most ARM and x86 computers! The operating system was designed for ease-of-use, customization, integration with starrbook hardware, AND not only that, it is the FIRST Linux distro to come with <a href= "https://github.com/mishastarrrr-ctrl/WinRocket">WinRocket</a>, which means it is able to run most Windows software out of the box! The operating system runs very smoothly and looks very good, which I hope you enjoy!

## Why I built this
I just wanted to make a better operating system, while learning some stuff about operating system development along the way.
